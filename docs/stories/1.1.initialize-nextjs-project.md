## Dev Notes

### Project Context

This is the **first story** in Epic 1 (Development Setup & Foundation) for the KBM.Design portfolio site. This is a greenfield Next.js project starting from scratch. The foundation must support future 3D interactive galleries, dynamic project pages, CMS integration, and analytics.

### Framework & Rendering Strategy

[Source: docs/architecture/2-frontend-architecture.md#framework-rendering]

**Next.js Configuration:**

- Use Next.js 14+ with **App Router** (not Pages Router)
- Configure support for multiple rendering strategies:
  - **SSG (Static Site Generation)** - For static pages like About, Gallery homepage
  - **ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)** - For project pages that update periodically
  - **SSR (Server-Side Rendering)** - Available for dynamic/personalized content
- Enable Edge rendering on Vercel for low latency

**React Three Fiber (R3F):**

- Powers the immersive 3D gallery component (future stories)
- Will render 3D geometry (cylinder/sphere) with project cards mapped to surface
- Requires `@react-three/fiber`, `@react-three/drei`, and `three.js`
- Needs WebGL support with CSS Grid fallback for non-WebGL devices

**UI Component Libraries:**

- **React Bits & Aceternity UI** - Provide ready-made components for floating nav bar, interactive cards, animations
- Compose with Tailwind CSS utilities
- Note: Verify package availability during installation; may need alternatives

**Tailwind CSS:**

- Already included in Next.js initialization
- Will use CSS variables for theming (Story 1.2 handles configuration)
- Dark theme with per-category accent colors

### Required Dependencies

[Source: docs/architecture/1-highlevel-overview.md, docs/architecture/2-frontend-architecture.md]

**Core Framework:**

- `next` (v14+)
- `react` (v18+)
- `react-dom` (v18+)
- `typescript`
- `@types/react`
- `@types/node`

**3D and Graphics:**

- `three` - Core 3D library
- `@react-three/fiber` - React renderer for Three.js
- `@react-three/drei` - Useful helpers for R3F

**Animation:**

- `gsap` - For scroll-synchronized animations with ScrollTrigger

**UI Components:**

- `react-bits` (verify availability)
- `aceternity-ui` or `@aceternity/ui` (verify package name)
- Note: These may need to be researched for correct package names or alternatives

**Styling:**

- `tailwindcss` (included with Next.js init)
- `postcss` (included with Next.js init)
- `autoprefixer` (included with Next.js init)

### Package Manager Choice

[Source: docs/prd/epic-1-development-setup.md#notes]

- Consider using **pnpm** instead of npm for faster installs and better disk space efficiency
- If using pnpm, ensure lock file is committed
- Either npm or pnpm is acceptable for this story

### TypeScript Configuration

**Strict Mode Required:**

- Enable `"strict": true` in tsconfig.json
- This enforces type safety and prevents common errors
- Ensure Next.js TypeScript plugin is enabled

### Performance Baseline

[Source: docs/architecture/6-performance-accessibility-considerations.md]

- Initial bundle size should remain reasonable (<200KB gzipped for main bundle)
- Use code splitting and dynamic imports for optional libraries
- Tree-shaking enabled by default in Next.js production builds
- Lazy load heavy dependencies (GSAP, R3F) only when needed (future optimization)

### Security Considerations

[Source: docs/architecture/7-security-privacy.md, docs/architecture/4-infrastructure-deployment.md]

- No sensitive data in client-side code
- Environment variables for API keys (not needed in this story, but prepare for future)
- Next.js automatically handles many security headers

### Project Structure Notes

**Standard Next.js App Router Structure:**

```
/app              - Application routes and pages (App Router)
/public           - Static assets
/node_modules     - Dependencies (git ignored)
package.json      - Dependency manifest
tsconfig.json     - TypeScript configuration
next.config.js    - Next.js configuration
tailwind.config.ts - Tailwind configuration
```

Additional folders will be created in Story 1.2:

- `/components` - Reusable React components
- `/lib` - Utility functions and helpers
- `/styles` - Global styles and CSS variables

### Testing

**Testing Standards:**

[Source: Architecture references testing but detailed strategy not yet in sharded docs]

For this story, testing requirements are minimal:

- **Manual verification** - Confirm dev server starts without errors
- **Visual verification** - Confirm test page renders in browser
- **Console verification** - Check for TypeScript errors or warnings

Formal unit/integration testing will be established in later stories. For now, focus on successful installation and basic functionality.

**Verification Checklist:**

- [ ] `npm run dev` starts without errors
- [ ] Browser loads `localhost:3000` successfully
- [ ] No TypeScript errors in terminal
- [ ] No console errors in browser DevTools
- [ ] Package.json lists all required dependencies

### Important Notes

- **React Bits and Aceternity UI**: These libraries may require verification of correct package names or availability. If unavailable on npm, document alternatives (e.g., shadcn/ui, Framer Motion, other animation libraries)
- **Version Pinning**: Consider pinning major versions to avoid breaking changes during development
- **Node Version**: Ensure Node.js 18+ is installed (check with `node --version`)

### CMS Integration Note

[Source: docs/architecture/3-content-data-layer.md]
The architecture mentions Sanity or Strapi as headless CMS options with media hosting on Cloudinary or S3. **This is NOT part of Story 1.1**. CMS integration will come in Epic 4. This story focuses only on front-end foundation.
