# 4. Key Requirements & Features

1. **Dynamic project pages** – Each case study must support images, video clips, animations, code demos and interactive prototypes. Layouts should be flexible yet built from a core component system.
2. **Consistent storytelling structure** – While layouts vary, each page should cover problem, approach, solution and outcomes, with optional sections for process or technical notes.
3. **Interactive gallery** – The homepage will feature an immersive browsing experience (e.g., 3‑D or bento‑style grid) that encourages exploration and highlights featured work.
4. **Personal information & contact** – A dedicated section describing background, skills and services, with clear contact methods (e.g., email, social links, booking link).
5. **Analytics & performance monitoring** – Integrate analytics to track metrics such as session duration, click‑through rates and popular projects. Use insights to improve content and layout.
6. **Content management & extensibility** – Implement a headless CMS or structured data source to add and edit projects without redeploying the site.
