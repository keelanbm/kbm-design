# 3. Target Audience & User Personas

1. **Peer designers** – Professionals or students seeking inspiration and insights into process and technique. They value detailed case studies, behind‑the‑scenes sketches and technical write‑ups.
2. **Potential clients or collaborators** – Businesses or individuals looking for a designer/developer who can deliver polished interfaces, motion effects and creative coding. They focus on portfolio quality, breadth of skills and clear contact pathways.

Navigation and content should cater to both personas—providing quick overviews and stats for busy clients and deeper dives for peers.
