# 6. Assumptions, Constraints & Risks

**Assumptions**

- Visitors use modern browsers capable of running WebGL and CSS animations; a 2‑D fallback will be provided.
- Adequate time and resources are available to create custom project pages and maintain a CMS.
- Potential clients are comfortable exploring a creative, non‑standard navigation paradigm.

**Constraints**

- Heavy motion design and 3‑D graphics can degrade load times and must be balanced with performance and accessibility.
- The project is led by a single designer/developer, so scope creep should be avoided to ensure timely launch.
- The chosen tech stack (React/Next.js, etc.) must align with hosting constraints (static vs. server rendering).

**Risks & Mitigations**

- **Performance risk** – Overusing animations may slow the site. Mitigate by optimising assets, lazy loading and enforcing performance budgets.
- **Design coherence** – Unique project layouts may lead to inconsistent user experience. Mitigate by defining core components and a shared narrative structure.
- **Maintenance overhead** – Custom layouts and media types may require more upkeep. Mitigate by using a flexible CMS and reusable templates.
- **Privacy & analytics** – Data collection must comply with privacy regulations. Mitigate with consent banners and anonymised analytics.
