# Epic 1: Development Setup & Foundation

## Epic Goal

Establish the foundational Next.js project structure with all required dependencies, configurations, and development tooling to enable efficient implementation of the KBM.Design portfolio site.

## Epic Description

This epic focuses on scaffolding the complete development environment for the portfolio site, ensuring all technical dependencies are properly configured and the project structure follows Next.js and React best practices.

### Context

This is a greenfield project building an interactive portfolio site from scratch. The foundation must support:

- Next.js with React 18+ for SSG/SSR/ISR rendering strategies
- React Three Fiber (R3F) for 3D interactive gallery
- Tailwind CSS for styling with custom theming
- Integration points for future CMS and analytics services
- Modern development tooling for TypeScript, linting, and testing

### Success Criteria

- Next.js project initialized with TypeScript support
- All core dependencies installed and verified working
- Development environment configured (ESLint, Prettier, Git hooks)
- Base folder structure established following architecture specifications
- Local development server running successfully
- Initial deployment pipeline to Vercel configured

## Stories

### Story 1.1: Initialize Next.js Project with Core Dependencies

**Description:** Set up the foundational Next.js project with TypeScript, install all required front-end libraries (React Three Fiber, Tailwind CSS, React Bits, Aceternity UI, GSAP), and verify the development environment runs successfully.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Next.js 14+ project initialized with TypeScript and App Router
- Package.json includes all dependencies from architecture specification
- Development server starts without errors (`npm run dev`)
- TypeScript configuration properly set up with strict mode
- Basic test page renders successfully at `localhost:3000`

**Key Dependencies:**

- Next.js 14+
- React 18+
- TypeScript
- @react-three/fiber, @react-three/drei
- Tailwind CSS
- GSAP
- React Bits, Aceternity UI components

### Story 1.2: Configure Project Structure and Development Tooling

**Description:** Establish the project folder structure according to Next.js App Router conventions, configure ESLint and Prettier for code quality, set up Git with appropriate ignore patterns, and configure Tailwind CSS with custom theme variables.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Folder structure created: `/app`, `/components`, `/lib`, `/public`, `/styles`
- ESLint configured with Next.js and TypeScript rules
- Prettier configured for consistent code formatting
- Git repository initialized with appropriate `.gitignore`
- Tailwind CSS configured with custom CSS variables for theming
- Pre-commit hooks set up (Husky/lint-staged) for code quality checks
- README.md created with project setup instructions

**Technical Notes:**
[Source: docs/architecture/2-frontend-architecture.md]

- Use CSS variables for dark theme: `--accent-work`, `--accent-motion`, etc.
- Tailwind config should expose custom color palette
- ESLint should enforce React/Next.js best practices

---

### Story 1.3: Set Up Vercel Deployment Pipeline and Environment Configuration

**Description:** Connect the project repository to Vercel, configure environment variables for different environments (development, preview, production), set up automatic deployments from main branch, and verify the initial deployment succeeds.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Project connected to Vercel account
- Automatic deployments configured for main branch
- Preview deployments enabled for pull requests
- Environment variables configured in Vercel dashboard (placeholders for future CMS/analytics)
- `.env.local.example` file created documenting required environment variables
- Initial deployment to Vercel successful and accessible via URL
- Build logs show no errors or warnings

**Technical Notes:**
[Source: docs/architecture/4-infrastructure-deployment.md]

- Vercel recommended for Next.js with built-in ISR and edge rendering support
- Configure for serverless functions support (future contact form)
- Enable Vercel Analytics if available

---

## Dependencies

**External Dependencies:**

- Node.js 18+ installed on development machine
- npm or pnpm package manager
- Git version control
- Vercel account (free tier acceptable for initial setup)
- GitHub repository (or similar Git hosting)

**Internal Dependencies:**

- None (this is the first epic)

## Technical Considerations

### Rendering Strategy

[Source: docs/architecture/2-frontend-architecture.md]

- Use SSG for static pages (About, Gallery)
- Configure ISR for project pages with revalidation
- SSR available for dynamic/personalized content

### Performance Baseline

[Source: docs/architecture/6-performance-accessibility-considerations.md]

- Ensure initial bundle size remains reasonable (<200KB gzipped for main bundle)
- Lighthouse score baseline of 90+ for initial deployment

### Security

[Source: docs/architecture/7-security-privacy.md]

- No sensitive data in client-side code
- Environment variables properly secured in Vercel
- Content Security Policy headers configured

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All three stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Local development environment documented and reproducible
- [ ] Vercel deployment pipeline operational
- [ ] No build errors or TypeScript errors
- [ ] Code quality tools enforcing standards
- [ ] Team can clone repository and run locally with documented steps
- [ ] Initial deployment accessible and verified

## Notes

- This epic establishes the foundation for all future development
- Any significant deviations from architecture specifications should be documented
- Consider using pnpm for faster installs and better disk space efficiency
- Ensure all team members have access to Vercel project and GitHub repository
