# 1. Overview & Purpose

KBM.Design is an interactive online portfolio showcasing the creator’s UX/UI design, motion design and “vibe coding” work. It will live in the `KBM_Design` folder and serve as a public reference for other designers and potential clients. The site will demonstrate polished design work and the author’s ability to build engaging front‑end experiences and motion/interaction effects. Each project page must support varied media and narrative formats while also providing information about the designer.
