# KBM.Design Architecture Overview

## 1. High‑Level Overview

KBM.Design is an interactive portfolio for showcasing UX/UI design, motion work and “vibe coding” projects. It needs to deliver polished visuals and smooth motion while remaining performant and easy to maintain. To achieve this the system is divided into three main layers:

1. **Presentation layer** – A Next.js front‑end built with React, React Three Fiber (R3F), Tailwind CSS, and supporting libraries like React Bits and Aceternity UI. This layer renders the 3‑D gallery, project pages and navigation. It includes client‑side components (for interactive effects) and server‑side/edge rendering for SEO and performance.
2. **Content & data layer** – A headless CMS (e.g., Sanity or Strapi) stores project metadata, text, images, videos and category definitions. Media assets are stored on a dedicated media service (e.g., Cloudinary or Amazon S3) and referenced from the CMS. A lightweight API fetches data at build time or per request.
3. **Infrastructure & services** – Hosting on Vercel (or Netlify) provides CDN distribution, serverless functions, and analytics. External services include analytics providers (e.g., Vercel Analytics, Google Analytics) and optional contact form/email services. Deployment scripts handle continuous integration and updates.

## 2. Front‑End Architecture

### Framework & Rendering

- **Next.js** provides routing, static generation (SSG), server‑side rendering (SSR) and incremental static regeneration (ISR). Use SSG for largely static pages (e.g., the About page, the 3‑D gallery), ISR for project pages that update periodically, and SSR for dynamic or personalised pages. Edge rendering can be enabled on Vercel for low latency.
- **React Three Fiber (R3F)** powers the immersive 3‑D grid. Create a cylinder or sphere geometry and map each project card onto its surface. Scroll events rotate the geometry, with fallback CSS Grid for non‑WebGL devices. Integrate GSAP ScrollTrigger for smooth synchronisation between scroll and 3‑D rotation.
- **React Bits & Aceternity UI** provide ready‑made components and animations (e.g., floating nav bar, interactive cards). Compose these with Tailwind CSS utilities and custom CSS variables to establish a dark theme and per‑category accent colours.
- **Tailwind CSS & CSS Variables** handle styling. Define a neutral dark palette and expose CSS variables (`--accent-work`, `--accent-motion`, etc.) that the UI and navigation can consume. Use utility classes for responsive design.

### State & Data Fetching

- **Static Data Loading** – Use `getStaticProps`/`getStaticPaths` to fetch project lists and individual project content from the CMS at build time. For content that changes frequently (e.g., blog posts or news), use ISR with a revalidation window.
- **Client Data Hooks** – Build custom React hooks to fetch additional data (e.g., related projects, analytics events) on the client side. Use SWR or React Query for caching and revalidation.
- **Context for Theme & Category** – Manage global state (selected category, colour palette, sound settings) via React Context or Zustand. Pass accent colours down to R3F materials and UI components.

## 3. Content & Data Layer

### Headless CMS

- **Choice** – Sanity and Strapi are flexible and widely used; both support custom schemas, rich media fields and image optimisation. Sanity offers a portable studio and real‑time updates; Strapi provides built‑in authentication and GraphQL generation.
- **Schema Design** – Define content types for Projects, Categories, and Site Settings. Each Project entry includes title, slug, description, media (images, videos), tags, accent colour, and optional fields like technology stack or role. Category entries define names and palette values; Site Settings store personal bio, contact information and nav labels.
- **Media Hosting** – Store large assets on a media platform (e.g., Cloudinary, S3). Use the CMS to reference these assets via secure URLs. Implement responsive images and different video formats (e.g., MP4 and HLS) for cross‑device compatibility.

### API Access

- **Data Fetching** – Query the CMS via its REST or GraphQL API. For static generation, perform these requests during build; for dynamic actions (e.g., search), call the API from serverless functions to keep keys secret.
- **CORS & Security** – Configure CORS to allow the front‑end domain. Secure API tokens using environment variables and avoid exposing them in client‑side code.

## 4. Infrastructure & Deployment

### Hosting & CD

- **Vercel** is recommended for Next.js projects due to built‑in support for serverless functions, ISR and edge rendering. It automatically handles CI/CD on pushes to the repository and integrates with analytics.
- **Netlify** is an alternative with similar capabilities (serverless functions, deploy previews). Choose based on familiarity and required features (Vercel supports edge functions more natively).

### Serverless Functions

- Use serverless functions for tasks that require secure processing or cannot run on the client, such as contact form submission, email sending or retrieving private CMS data. Place them in the `api/` directory of Next.js.
- If needed, set up an SSR/edge function to handle user‑specific interactions (e.g., sound preferences stored in cookies).

### CDN & Caching

- Leverage the hosting platform’s CDN to serve static assets and generated pages globally. Use cache headers and `revalidate` settings in Next.js to control freshness of ISR pages.
- Optimise media with automatic image compression and responsive sizing. Lazy load 3‑D models and videos to minimise initial payload.

## 5. Analytics & Monitoring

- **Web Vitals & Custom Events** – Use Next.js’s `reportWebVitals` to capture performance metrics (first contentful paint, time to interactive) and forward them to an analytics provider.
- **User Behaviour** – Instrument click events on project cards, category switches and contact actions. Send anonymised events to your analytics service to measure engagement.
- **Error Tracking** – Integrate with Sentry or a similar service to capture client and server errors for proactive maintenance.

## 6. Performance & Accessibility Considerations

- **Lazy Loading** – Load 3‑D assets, videos and heavy images only when they enter the viewport. Provide skeleton placeholders while content loads.
- **Fallbacks** – Offer a 2‑D grid for devices that cannot handle WebGL or have reduced motion settings. Use feature detection and respect `prefers-reduced-motion` to disable heavy animations.
- **Optimised Bundles** – Take advantage of React Server Components and code splitting to minimise client‑side JavaScript. Use tree‑shaking and dynamic imports for optional libraries (e.g., GSAP).
- **Accessibility** – Ensure text contrasts meet WCAG guidelines. Provide keyboard navigation, focus indicators and alt text for all images.

## 7. Security & Privacy

- **Content Security Policy (CSP)** – Define a strict CSP header to prevent XSS attacks. Only allow scripts, styles and media from your domain and trusted third parties (CMS, analytics, media hosts).
- **Authentication** – If you add an admin area, secure it with authentication and use role‑based access control in the CMS.
- **Privacy Compliance** – Implement a cookie/consent banner if analytics use cookies or local storage. Provide a privacy policy describing data collection.

## 8. Future Extensions

- **Blog & Tutorials** – Add a blog section using the same CMS to share insights and tutorials for peer designers. This content can be statically generated and paginated.
- **E‑commerce or Booking** – Integrate a store for selling digital assets or services. Use third‑party commerce APIs and serverless functions to handle payments securely.
- **Progressive Web App (PWA)** – Enable offline support and installability to let users browse case studies without a network.

## Conclusion

This architecture balances a rich, interactive front‑end with a flexible content backend and scalable infrastructure. By leveraging Next.js features (SSR/SSG/ISR), React Three Fiber for 3‑D experiences, and a headless CMS for content management, KBM.Design can deliver engaging storytelling while remaining performant and maintainable. Serverless functions and analytics provide the glue for secure operations and insight into user behaviour, while careful attention to performance and accessibility ensures the site works well across devices.
