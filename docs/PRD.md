# KBM.Design Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Overview & Purpose

KBM.Design is an interactive online portfolio showcasing the creator’s UX/UI design, motion design and “vibe coding” work. It will live in the `KBM_Design` folder and serve as a public reference for other designers and potential clients. The site will demonstrate polished design work and the author’s ability to build engaging front‑end experiences and motion/interaction effects. Each project page must support varied media and narrative formats while also providing information about the designer.

## 2. Goals & Objectives

- **Elevate personal brand** – Increase awareness of the designer’s capabilities and style through a memorable portfolio.
- **Showcase design and technical proficiency** – Present high‑quality UX/UI, motion design and code experiments in an engaging format. Demonstrate interactive layouts and animation techniques.
- **Facilitate client understanding and contact** – Allow potential clients or collaborators to quickly assess the designer’s skills and easily get in touch.
- **Support flexible storytelling** – Enable each project page to tell its story in a way that suits its medium (images, videos, code demos) while following a consistent narrative structure.
- **Encourage exploration** – Use immersive navigation and clear teasers to maximise time on site and click‑through to individual projects.

## 3. Target Audience & User Personas

1. **Peer designers** – Professionals or students seeking inspiration and insights into process and technique. They value detailed case studies, behind‑the‑scenes sketches and technical write‑ups.
2. **Potential clients or collaborators** – Businesses or individuals looking for a designer/developer who can deliver polished interfaces, motion effects and creative coding. They focus on portfolio quality, breadth of skills and clear contact pathways.

Navigation and content should cater to both personas—providing quick overviews and stats for busy clients and deeper dives for peers.

## 4. Key Requirements & Features

1. **Dynamic project pages** – Each case study must support images, video clips, animations, code demos and interactive prototypes. Layouts should be flexible yet built from a core component system.
2. **Consistent storytelling structure** – While layouts vary, each page should cover problem, approach, solution and outcomes, with optional sections for process or technical notes.
3. **Interactive gallery** – The homepage will feature an immersive browsing experience (e.g., 3‑D or bento‑style grid) that encourages exploration and highlights featured work.
4. **Personal information & contact** – A dedicated section describing background, skills and services, with clear contact methods (e.g., email, social links, booking link).
5. **Analytics & performance monitoring** – Integrate analytics to track metrics such as session duration, click‑through rates and popular projects. Use insights to improve content and layout.
6. **Content management & extensibility** – Implement a headless CMS or structured data source to add and edit projects without redeploying the site.

## 5. Success Metrics & Measurement

- **Average session duration** – Measures how long visitors spend exploring the portfolio; longer sessions imply engagement.
- **Click‑through rate (CTR)** – Percentage of homepage/project card clicks that lead to deeper project pages or contact actions.
- **Portfolio enquiries** – Number of contact form submissions or email inquiries originating from the site.
- **Qualitative feedback on aesthetics** – Gather feedback from peers and early users about visual appeal and usability via surveys or testimonials.

## 6. Assumptions, Constraints & Risks

**Assumptions**

- Visitors use modern browsers capable of running WebGL and CSS animations; a 2‑D fallback will be provided.
- Adequate time and resources are available to create custom project pages and maintain a CMS.
- Potential clients are comfortable exploring a creative, non‑standard navigation paradigm.

**Constraints**

- Heavy motion design and 3‑D graphics can degrade load times and must be balanced with performance and accessibility.
- The project is led by a single designer/developer, so scope creep should be avoided to ensure timely launch.
- The chosen tech stack (React/Next.js, etc.) must align with hosting constraints (static vs. server rendering).

**Risks & Mitigations**

- **Performance risk** – Overusing animations may slow the site. Mitigate by optimising assets, lazy loading and enforcing performance budgets.
- **Design coherence** – Unique project layouts may lead to inconsistent user experience. Mitigate by defining core components and a shared narrative structure.
- **Maintenance overhead** – Custom layouts and media types may require more upkeep. Mitigate by using a flexible CMS and reusable templates.
- **Privacy & analytics** – Data collection must comply with privacy regulations. Mitigate with consent banners and anonymised analytics.

## 7. Timeline & Milestones

| Phase                                | Activities                                                                                                                                                            | Duration            |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Planning & Design**                | Finalise site architecture, navigation and design system; sketch wireframes and high‑fidelity mock‑ups for the homepage, about section and a sample project page.     | 1–2 weeks           |
| **Development Setup**                | Scaffold the Next.js project; configure Tailwind CSS; install React Three Fiber, React Bits and other dependencies; set up analytics and performance monitoring.      | 1 week              |
| **Core Functionality**               | Build the immersive gallery/grid component; implement routing to dynamic project pages; develop the floating navigation bar and responsive design; integrate the CMS. | 2–3 weeks           |
| **Content Migration & Custom Pages** | Create or import case studies and populate the CMS; design unique layouts for each project page as needed, using modular components.                                  | 2–4 weeks (ongoing) |
| **Testing & Refinement**             | Conduct usability testing with peers; gather qualitative feedback; optimise performance; fix bugs and refine animations.                                              | 1 week              |

## 8. Summary & Next Steps

This PRD outlines the vision, objectives, audience, features, success metrics, risks and schedule for KBM.Design. The site aims to showcase the designer’s work and technical ability through an engaging, interactive portfolio while remaining flexible for future growth. Immediate next steps include refining the visual design system, selecting a CMS, building a lean initial version of the site with core projects, and gathering feedback after launch to guide iterative improvements.
