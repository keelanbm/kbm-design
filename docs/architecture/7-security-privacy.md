# 7. Security & Privacy

- **Content Security Policy (CSP)** – Define a strict CSP header to prevent XSS attacks. Only allow scripts, styles and media from your domain and trusted third parties (CMS, analytics, media hosts).
- **Authentication** – If you add an admin area, secure it with authentication and use role‑based access control in the CMS.
- **Privacy Compliance** – Implement a cookie/consent banner if analytics use cookies or local storage. Provide a privacy policy describing data collection.
