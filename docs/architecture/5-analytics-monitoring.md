# 5. Analytics & Monitoring

- **Web Vitals & Custom Events** – Use Next.js’s `reportWebVitals` to capture performance metrics (first contentful paint, time to interactive) and forward them to an analytics provider.
- **User Behaviour** – Instrument click events on project cards, category switches and contact actions. Send anonymised events to your analytics service to measure engagement.
- **Error Tracking** – Integrate with Sentry or a similar service to capture client and server errors for proactive maintenance.
