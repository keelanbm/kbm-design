# Conclusion

This architecture balances a rich, interactive front‑end with a flexible content backend and scalable infrastructure. By leveraging Next.js features (SSR/SSG/ISR), React Three Fiber for 3‑D experiences, and a headless CMS for content management, KBM.Design can deliver engaging storytelling while remaining performant and maintainable. Serverless functions and analytics provide the glue for secure operations and insight into user behaviour, while careful attention to performance and accessibility ensures the site works well across devices.
